This repository provides some examples to demostrate working of basic MPI constructs such as MPI_Send, MPI_Recv, MPI_Bcast, MPI_Scatter, MPI_Gather, MPI_Reduce etc. <br>
To compile an MPI based C program: mpicc file_name.c <br>
To run a program output: mpirun -np 4 ./a.out <br>
&emsp; where 4 represents the number of processes.
